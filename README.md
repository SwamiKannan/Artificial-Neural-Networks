# Deep Neural Networks
![The brain as a feed forward network](intro.png)<br>
These are projects and assignments that I have done using vanilla-Deep Learning networks (without CNN / Sequence Models). These were an exploration of various libraries such as Numpy, Pytorch, Keras and basic Tensorflow
 Projects include:
 1. Model design using Numpy - Developing my own two-layer DNN from scratch on the MNIST dataset
 2. Model design using PyTorch - The IRIS dataset and the NYC Taxi datasets
 3. Model design using Keras - Number recognition using DNN
 4. deeplearning.ai Deep Learning Specialization - Courses 1 - 3
