# Deep Learning Specialization
The Deep Learning Specialization is a foundational program that helps understand the capabilities, challenges, and consequences of deep learning and prepare you to participate in the development of leading-edge AI technology. 

## Applied Learning Project
By the end you’ll be able to:

•	Build and train deep neural networks, implement vectorized neural networks, identify architecture parameters, and apply DL to your applications

•	Use best practices to train and develop test sets and analyze bias/variance for building DL applications, use standard NN techniques, apply optimization algorithms, and implement a neural network in TensorFlow

•	Use strategies for reducing errors in ML systems, understand complex ML settings, and apply end-to-end, transfer, and multi-task learning.


This repo covers the programming assignments for the first three courses of the Specialization:
1.	Neural Networks and Deep Learning
2.	Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization
3.	Structuring Machine Learning Projects
